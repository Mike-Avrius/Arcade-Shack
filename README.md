**About the Game**

Whack-a-Mole is a casual arcade mini-game developed as part of the Arcade Shack project.
The game is designed for Android and aims to recreate the fun and nostalgia of old-school arcade machines with a modern low-poly neon graffiti style.

This is an early working prototype â€” illustrations, visual polish, and additional mini-games are planned for future updates.

**Gameplay**

Tap the moles as fast as you can before they disappear.

Earn points for each successful hit.

At the end of the round, your points are converted into tickets.

Tickets will be used later to unlock new arcade machines and customize the arcade room.

**Controls**

Tap anywhere on the screen to hit moles.
